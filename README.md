Requirements
Microsoft Visual Studio: A popular IDE for C++ development. Download the free Community edition from the official Microsoft website: Microsoft Visual Studio Download
Git: A version control system. Download the latest version from the official Git website: Git Downloads
Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable: Ensure you have the correct version installed on your system by downloading and installing the latest version from the official Microsoft website: Visual C++ Redistributable Downloads
Usage Guide
Download and install the required applications mentioned above.
Clone the Git repository containing the DLL project with the following command:
git clone https://github.com/aioo-pau/hitman3-dlc-unlocker.git
Replace "aioo-pau" with the actual GitHub username if it has changed.
Open the Hitman 3 DLL Unlocker project in Visual Studio. a. Go to File > Open > Project/Solution. b. Browse to the hitman3-dlc-unlocker directory. c. Select the hitman3-dlc-unlocker.sln file.
Customize the variables within the dlc_unlocker.cpp file according to your system:
a. Update the game_exe_path variable with the actual path to your Hitman 3 game executable.
b. Replace the dlcs variable with the actual file names, file sizes, and file paths of the DLC files.
Implement the dlc_unlock function in the define_dlc_unlocker.cpp file using reverse engineering techniques to perform the actual DLC unlocking.
Build the project to create the dlc_unlocker.dll library.
a. In Visual Studio, open the Build menu and click Build Solution.
b. After the build is successful, the dlc_unlocker.dll will be in the project directory.
Copy the generated dlc_unlocker.dll library to the directory where the Hitman 3 game executable is located.
Optionally, create a batch file or shortcut to load the DLL when starting Hitman 3. To do this, create a new batch file (.bat) with the following content:
@echo off
set DLL_PATH=%~dp0%
start /wait "" "%DLL_PATH%Hitman3.exe"
Replace %~dp0% with the correct directory path of the Hitman3.exe if needed. After saving the batch file, double-click it to run the game with the DLL loaded.
Start the Hitman 3 game. The DLL DLC unlocker will be automatically loaded.
